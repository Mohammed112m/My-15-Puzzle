How the game works:

When the page loads:
    Set the level to Level 1
    Set the timer based on the level

When player clicks Start:
    Start the timer
    Start the game

After each move:
    Check if squares  are in correct order (1 to 15)
    If correct:
    Stop the timer
    Display "You Win!"
     Go to the next level

    Each level increases difficulty by shuffling squares  more
